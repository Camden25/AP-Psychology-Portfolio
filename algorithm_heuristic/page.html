            This activity explores the differences between algorithmic and heuristic approaches to problem-solving. Each method is applied to a specific puzzle, and their efficiency and accuracy are compared.

                    <p><strong>Algorithm Approach:</strong> Sorting pieces by color and shape, starting with edges.</p>

                    <p><strong>Heuristic Approach:</strong> Focusing on distinctive pieces or assembling recognizable sections.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p class="discussion">
                <strong>Discussion:</strong> The heuristic and algorithmic approaches took around the same amount of time. The heuristic approach started much faster but slowed down due to the pieces not being sorted.

            </div>
            <p class="discussion">
                <strong>Discussion:</strong> The algorithmic approach was more consistent in how long it took. I got stuck for a bit during the heuristic approach but it was still signifigantly faster because I was looking for the words instead of searching every square.
