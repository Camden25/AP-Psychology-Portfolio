            <h1>Creative Thinking Workshop</h1>
            <p>
                In this activity, I was tasked with attaching a candle to the wall while preventing wax from dripping onto the floor. Using a candle, a box of tacks, and a binder clip I approached the challenge step by step while reflecting on the influence of functional fixedness and the strategies I used to think creatively.
            </p>
            <h2>Functional Fixedness</h2>
            <p>
                Initially, I struggled because I was stuck seeing the objects only in their traditional roles. For example, I saw the tacks as tools to secure the candle directly and the box as a container, not realizing they could be used in other ways. This mental block limited my ability to come up with creative solutions at first.
            </p>
            <h2>Divergent Thinking</h2>
            <p>
                After some frustration, I started to experiment with unconventional ideas. I thought about how the box could act as a platform for the candle. By rethinking the purpose of each object, I was able to create a solution that worked: I tacked the box to the wall and placed the candle inside it. This prevented the wax from dripping onto the floor.
            </p>
            <h2>Executive Functions</h2>
            <p>
                Throughout the experiment, my executive functions played a significant role. Problem-solving helped me evaluate multiple approaches, cognitive flexibility allowed me to adapt my thinking when a strategy didnâ€™t work, and self-monitoring kept me focused on the objective despite initial setbacks.
            </p>
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>
                This experience taught me how functional fixedness can limit creativity and emphasized the importance of divergent thinking. It also showed how executive functions are crucial in navigating complex challenges. In the end, I successfully attached the candle to the wall and prevented wax from dripping onto the floor.
