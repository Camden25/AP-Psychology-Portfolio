                <p class="description">We know that the chair is very close to the camera because it is blurry. It is not at the distance we are focusing on so it is not clear.</p>

        <!-- Perceptual Constancy Section -->
        <section>
            <h2>Perceptual Constancy</h2>

        <!-- Binocular Cues Section -->
        <section id="retinal-disparity">
            <h2>Retinal Disparity</h2>
            <p>Retinal disparity refers to the slight difference in the images perceived by each eye due to their horizontal separation. This difference helps our brain perceive depth.</p>
            <div class="image-comparison">
              <div class="image-wrapper">
                <img src="binocular_left.jpg" alt="Photo taken closer to the left eye">
                <p>Photo from the left perspective</p>
              </div>
              <div class="image-wrapper">
                <img src="binocular_right.jpg" alt="Photo taken closer to the right eye">
                <p>Photo from the right perspective</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <p>In the two photos, you can see the slight differences in perspective, which simulate how each eye views the world. Our brain uses these differences to calculate depth.</p>
        </section>          

        <!-- Change Blindness Section -->
        <section id="change-blindness">
            <h2>Change Blindness</h2>
            <p>
              Change blindness occurs when changes in a visual scene go unnoticed due to inattention. I tested this by making a subtle change to my surroundings and capturing photos before and after the change.
            </p>
            <div class="image-stack">
              <div class="image-wrapper">
                <img src="before_change.jpg" alt="Scene before the change">
                <p>Before the change: This is the original setup.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="image-wrapper">
                <img src="after_change.jpg" alt="Scene after the change">
                <p>After the change: I removed the cap from the whiteboard marker and I switched which chair was further from the table.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <p>
              Many people didnâ€™t notice the change at first because their attention was focused on more central objects in the scene. This demonstrates how we rely on assumptions to process visual information and can overlook small differences unless we are actively looking for them.
