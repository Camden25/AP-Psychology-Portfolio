                <p class="description">My shoe is closer to the camera than rohail so it looks like I am crushing him with my show even though my shoe is much smaller than him. We know the shoe is closer because it is larger than it should be.</p>

                <p class="description">We know that the chair is very close to the camera because it is blurry. It is not at the distance we are focusing on so it is not clear.</p>
