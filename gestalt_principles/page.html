            Gestalt psychology explains how humans naturally organize visual elements into groups or unified wholes. Below, you will find examples and explanations of key Gestalt principles.
        </p>

        <!-- Closure -->
        <section>
            <h2>Closure</h2>
            <img src="closure_example.jpg" alt="Closure Example">
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Closure refers to the mind's ability to fill in gaps to perceive a complete image.</p>
            <p class="description">
                <strong>Explanation:</strong> In this image, partial outlines of a shape are presented. Even though parts of the shape are missing, the brain perceives it as a whole due to the principle of closure.
            </p>

        <!-- Figure and Ground -->
        <section>
            <h2>Figure and Ground</h2>
            <img src="figure_and_ground_example.jpg" alt="Figure and Ground Example">
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Figure and ground refer to the visual separation of objects (figure) from their background (ground).</p>
            <p class="description">
                <strong>Explanation:</strong> This image shows how the vase (figure) and the background (ground) alternate depending on what you focus on. This demonstrates how the brain separates visual elements into distinct layers.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Proximity -->
        <section>
            <h2>Proximity</h2>
            <img src="proximity_example.jpg" alt="Proximity Example">
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Proximity refers to the grouping of objects that are physically close to each other.</p>
            <p class="description">
                <strong>Explanation:</strong> In this image, individual dots are arranged closer to one another in certain areas. The brain groups them into clusters, illustrating the principle of proximity.
            </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Similarity -->
        <section>
            <h2>Similarity</h2>
            <img src="similarity_example.jpg" alt="Similarity Example">
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Similarity refers to the grouping of objects that are visually similar in shape, size, color, or other attributes.</p>
            <p class="description">
                <strong>Explanation:</strong> This image shows circles and squares. The brain groups the shapes by their similarity, organizing circles into one group and squares into another.
