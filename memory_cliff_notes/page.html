            <h2>Encoding Memories</h2>
            <p>Encoding is the process of transforming sensory input into a form that can be stored in memory. When we first encounter information, it needs to be encoded before it can be retained and later retrieved.</p>
            <p><strong>Mnemonic Devices:</strong> These are techniques used to help remember information, such as acronyms or rhymes.</p>
            <p><strong>Chunking:</strong> Chunking involves grouping information into larger, more manageable units, such as remembering a phone number in sections (e.g., 555-123-4567).</p>
            <p><strong>Spacing Effect:</strong> This is the phenomenon where information is better remembered if studied over time, rather than in one long session.</p>
            <p><strong>Primacy and Recency Effect:</strong> We tend to remember the first (primacy) and last (recency) items in a series best.</p>

            <h2>Storing Memories</h2>
            <p>Storing memories involves maintaining information over time so it can be retrieved when needed. Different parts of the brain are responsible for different types of memory storage.</p>
            <p><strong>Maintenance Rehearsal:</strong> This involves repeating information over and over to keep it in short-term memory.</p>
            <p><strong>Elaborative Rehearsal:</strong> This involves thinking about the meaning of information and connecting it to existing knowledge, which strengthens memory.</p>
            <p><strong>Amnesia:</strong> This is the loss of memory, which can result from brain injury or psychological trauma. There are two main types of amnesia: retrograde (loss of past memories) and anterograde (inability to form new memories).</p>

        <section id="retrieving">
            <h2>Retrieving Memories</h2>
            <p>Retrieving memories refers to the process of bringing stored information back into conscious awareness. This process is not always perfect, and various factors can influence how easily we retrieve memories.</p>
            <p><strong>Context-Dependent Memory:</strong> Our memory retrieval is often influenced by the context or environment in which we learned the information. For example, being in the same room where you studied can help you remember.</p>
            <p><strong>Mood-Congruent Memory:</strong> Our mood at the time of retrieval can affect what memories come to mind. For example, when you're happy, you're more likely to remember positive events.</p>
            <p><strong>State-Dependent Memory:</strong> This suggests that we're more likely to remember information if we're in the same physical or emotional state as when we learned it, such as remembering something learned while drunk if you're drunk again.</p>

        <section id="mnemonic">
            <h2>Mnemonic Devices</h2>
            <p>Mnemonic devices are memory aids that help improve memory and recall. They make use of associations or patterns to make the information easier to remember.</p>
            <p><strong>Examples of Mnemonic Devices:</strong> Acronyms (e.g., ROYGBIV for the colors of the rainbow), visualization (e.g., imagining a vivid scene to remember something), rhymes (e.g., “I before E except after C”), and chunking (e.g., grouping numbers into sections).</p>
